            recipe: "Zaatar ====== _A.k.a. za‘tar, za’atar, zattr, etc._ Zaatar is a thyme-based Middle Eastern seasoning that adapts well to tacos. It has a pleasantly dry, faintly sour/bitter flavor. It goes well on savory bases like squash and lamb, and combines with other sour seasonings like lemon juice and radish. There are many kinds of zaatar, some quite different; this recipe is representative, not definitive. * 4 units thyme * 2 units oregano * 2 units sesame seeds * 0–1 unit salt * 1 unit sumac (to be found at a Lebanese or Syrian market, or at a yuppie grocery; in a pinch, lemon zest can substitute) * Other herbs to taste: fennel pollen, marjoram, cumin, etc. * Optional: trace olive oil or lemon juice as a binder (but not if you plan to store it) Toast the sesame seeds. Grind all ingredients together using any method, stopping when the mixture is not too fine to pick up by pinching. May be added to meat during cooking, or sprinkled over a finshied taco. The latest theories have not ruled out the possibility of a zaatar mole. tags: vegetarian, vegan "

            recipe: "Hard Corn Shells (Traditional; US) ====================== Mistakenly thought by many to be traditionally Mexican, hard shells were actually popularized in the US in the mid-20th century. While they can certainly be made at home (if you have access to a deep-fryer), the best method of obtaining hard taco shells is to head to the grocery store. If you line them with a lettuce leaf rather than using chopped lettuce, when the shell cracks you won't lose the contents into your lap. tags: vegetarian "

            recipe: "# Fat-Poached Carnitas * 3 pounds of boneless pork shoulder or uncured picnic ham (see note for how to select). * 0.25 to 0.50 cups of liquified fat (oil, lard or duck fat is acceptable) * 10 to 15 garlic cloves (roasted preferred) * 1 lemon, sliced into thin circles and those are quartered * coarse salt * black pepper 1. Heat oven to 250 degrees. 2. Cube pork shoulder in roughly 3-inch chunks. 3. Salt and pepper the cubes aggressively. 4. Stuff cubes tightly (very tightly) into the smallest, deepest baking dish available. 5. Stuff garlic and lemon between the cubes. 6. Pour fat over cubes to just cover. 7. Bake in oven for 5 hours. 8. Remove dish from oven. 9. Cover a sheet pan with foil. 10. With slotted spoon, remove the pork to the sheet pan and spread out in a single layer. 11. Turn on broiler. 12. Broil pork in sheet pan until it is somewhat blackened and crispy, probably 4-6 minutes. YMMV because broilers are ridiculous. 13. Remove from oven and tease with fork. ## Notes * A nice thick fat cap on the top of the pork is preferable. * Ask your butcher to remove any bones. * Do not use cured meat. "
